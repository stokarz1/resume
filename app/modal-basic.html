			Hi, I'm Steve Tokarz and this is my interactive resume.
		</div>
		<div class="welcomeBody">
			<p>
				I wrote this site to better learn Angular.js 2, now known as simply Angular.  
				This makes googling and searching stackoverflow for information on the correct verson much more difficult than if they chose absolutely any other name.
				I'm also using the Bootstrap 4 alpha to see what's new there.
			</p>
			<p>
				This site has a few tricks I wanted to try out in Angular.  If you click on any of the tasks in the Employment section it will show you what technology was used to perform that task.
				You can also search for a specific technology in the search box in the header and all tasks with the corresponding technology will be highlighted.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you don't want to use this interactive version of my resume, you can download a pdf version <a href="app/tokarz_resume.pdf">here</a>.
				Also, if you want to view the source of this project on github at <a href="https://github.com/stokarz1/resume">https://github.com/stokarz1/resume</a>
				Thanks for visiting and if you want to see this modal again simply click on the "?" button in the header.
